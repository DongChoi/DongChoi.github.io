# This is my new personal website for my domain at andrewchoi.dev

I made a new one because the old was using a template I got off of HTML5UP. I wanted to create my own design and have more flexibility using NextJS instead of vanilla HTML, scripts and css. I picked up tailwind recently and wanted to practice more animations and color schemes for accessibility! Right now.
- Responsive design up to macbook pro 13 inch size.
